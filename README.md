# Welcome!
## This is a project to learn how to make a slider to implement into my personal website to showcase my projects!

### What I Learned
- User Experience (UX) Design: Developing an intuitive and user-friendly interface with smooth interaction, visual feedback, and clear labels for range values.
- HTML & CSS Fundamentals
- JavaScript for Interactivity: The range slider’s dynamic behavior (e.g., changing the value as you move the slider) required handling events like input or change, and updating the UI in real-time.
- DOM Manipulation: Worked with the Document Object Model (DOM) to access, modify, and respond to changes in HTML elements, which is essential for updating the range slider’s value and reflecting changes on the webpage.
